	 <p> The Language of Java What is Java. Java, in it’s simplest definition, is a dynamic computer application that can run a program to accomplish a task. Java runs in all sorts of things in the average person’s life; things such as car stereo systems, televisions, cell phone applications, websites, and more. But, where did it come from, and how does it work, and how has it impacted our lives today. Java was first created by Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and James Gosling in 1994. However, they started writing the code for it four years earlier in 1990....   [tags: browser, computing, commands, web] </p>

	 <p> Popularity of Java Java is a programming language designed to run dynamic, interactive and secure applications on computer systems. Java has several features which make it extremely popular. Even though Java has obtained remarkable popularity through it’s use on the internet, Java has also been adapted to the operating systems of several electronic devices which are commonly used. How Java is used in the industry Since Java’s inception in 1995, it began to spread throughout the programming world like a virus, gaining popularity everywhere it is used....

	 <p>Comparison of Java, JavaScript, Java Applets and Java Beans Introduction Starting back in the early 1990's with the introduction of Java to the computer scene there has been many updates and advances in how languages interact with web based programs. In this paper we are going to highlight several areas of several different Java flavors. The flavors we are addressing are Java, JavaScript, Java Applets and JavaBeans. We will discuss their history, features, usage and syntax and finally follow up with a chart providing a comparison of the different Java architectures.	History Java, a language based on C++, was developed by James Gosling and colleagues at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990's... .</p>

	 <p> Java is one of many high-level programming languages that use abstraction (reducing and factoring details) to create software for computers and many other electronic devices. Compared to low-level programming languages, high-level programming languages use a mixture of natural language (any language used by humans) and typical computer terms to create an easier to understand and simpler form of programming. Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in writing a simple program called “Hello World” in Assembly (a low-level programming language) and in Java.... . </p>

	 <p>Abstract—High Performance Computing (HPC) provides support to run advanced application programs efficiently. Java adaptation in HPC has become an apparent choice for new endeavors, because of its significant characteristics. These include object-oriented, platform independent, portable, secure, built-in networking, multithreading, and an extensive set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Consequently multi-core systems and multi-core programming tools are becoming popular. However, today the leading HPC programming model is Message Passing Interface (MPI).... </p>
